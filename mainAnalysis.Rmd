To-Do
-table of top shot value players
-plot of shot value v. shots taken
-shot chart fxn (ngames, ndates, % by quad)
-find best defenders (impact on/off)
-best overall on/off (defensive and offensive on/off)
-good shooters good shots (after logos)


-read in all 2021-22 data
-get team logos into a dataframe
